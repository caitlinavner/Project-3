# Excelsior Comics!

## Description:

AS a fan of comics/manga, I WANT to search for new titles and save them to a reading list, SO THAT I can discover new books to read and connect with a community of fellow readers
Excelsior! is a platform for casual comics fans and diehards alike. At its most basic level, users will be able to sign up for an account, search for titles featuring their favorite characters (or randomize suggestions), and save books to a reading list. Further development will add community interactions and recommendations.
Especially for casual fans, getting into comics can be intimidating. Having a platform to help generate suggestions through the use of third party APIs, as well peer to peer community interactions, is a great way for new readers to get started and connect with other fans.

**Page 1**: Login page with button rerouting to sign up page.

**Page 2**: Sign up page with request for personal info(first name, last name, email address and password).

**Page 3**: Search page where user can search by character or comic book title. Cards displaying comic book covers will display along with an add button so users can add their favorites to their 'Profile' page.

**Page 4**(further development): Profile Page where user can store favorites to a reading list and add notes.
